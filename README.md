- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate quick integration and usage.

## Getting Started
To get started with integrating ChatGPT into your Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Configure API Key**: Obtain your ChatGPT API key and update it in the application properties.
3. **Build and Run**: Build the application using Maven and run it locally to test the integration.
4. **Integrate**: Integrate ChatGPT functionalities into your application as required.
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to your preferred hosting environment for production use.

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the ChatGPT integration within your Spring Boot application:

```java
